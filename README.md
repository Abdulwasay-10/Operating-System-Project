# Operating-System-Project
The Mini OS Simulator is a comprehensive C++ application designed to emulate the core functional components of a modern operating system. Developed as a solution to the "Complex Computing Problem" (CCP), this project bridges the gap between theoretical operating system concepts and practical low-level implementation.
